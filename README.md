_Thank you for purchasing or showing interest in my material converter :3 !!_

There is no way to convert HDRP materials back into URP correctly,
but that will be worked on if this asset gets more support.

Report any issues on the GitHub page!

If you haven't purchased this asset, please consider doing it so [on its Unity asset store page](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/292948)
I rarely ever use Unity, so the chances of this project being maintained and being further developed for free are pretty rare!
